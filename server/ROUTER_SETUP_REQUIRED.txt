====================================
  ROUTER PORT FORWARDING SETUP
====================================

⚠️ YOUR ROUTER MUST BE CONFIGURED FOR EXTERNAL ACCESS

Server Status: ✅ RUNNING
Local Access: ✅ WORKING
External Access: ❌ BLOCKED BY ROUTER

====================================

📋 PORT FORWARDING CONFIGURATION:

Router Admin: http://192.168.1.1
(or check router manual for admin URL)

ADD THIS PORT FORWARDING RULE:
────────────────────────────────
Service Name:    WeVibin Server
External Port:   3001
Internal IP:     192.168.1.21
Internal Port:   3001
Protocol:        TCP (or TCP/UDP)
────────────────────────────────

====================================

🔍 HOW TO FIND ROUTER SETTINGS:

1. Open browser and go to: http://192.168.1.1
   (Try 192.168.0.1 if that doesn't work)

2. Login with admin credentials
   (Often printed on router or in manual)

3. Look for one of these sections:
   - Port Forwarding
   - Virtual Server
   - NAT / NAT Forwarding
   - Advanced → Port Forwarding
   - Gaming / Applications

4. Add the rule above

5. Save and reboot router if needed

====================================

🧪 AFTER CONFIGURING, TEST WITH:

From external device browser:
http://41.38.46.220:3001/socket.io/socket.io.js

You should see JavaScript code starting with:
"/*! Socket.IO v4.8.1"

====================================

📞 ALTERNATIVE IF YOU CAN'T ACCESS ROUTER:

Contact your ISP or network administrator to:
- Enable port forwarding for port 3001
- Ensure port 3001 is not blocked
- Check if you have a public IP (not CGNAT)
